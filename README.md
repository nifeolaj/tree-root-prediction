# tree-root-prediction

This repository contains the course project for the **Machine Learning** course at **Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya (UPC)**, completed as part of the **Big Data Management and Analytics (BDMA)** Erasmus Mundus Master's program.

## Project Overview

The objective of this project is to apply machine learning techniques to a real-world graph-based NLP problem: **predicting the root node of a syntactic dependency tree**. These trees are extracted from a multilingual parallel corpus comprising 21 languages.

The task is framed as a **binary classification** problem at the **node level**—for each node in the tree, predict whether it is the root or not. The central hypothesis is that **graph centrality measures** can help identify the root node based on its structural importance.
